Time Complexity Analysis:

1. Task0:
    First record in texts : O(n) => List constructor has to iterate thru all items
    Last record in calls : O(n) => List constructor has to iterate thru all items

2. Task1:
    Different phone numbers: O(n) => iterate thru all the entries 2 * O(n), push the records to set O(1), print the count O(1)

3. Task2:
    O(n) => Since we iterate the records only once.

4. Task3:
    O(n log n) => O(n) for iteration of records + O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for printing the results

5. Task 4:
    O(n log n) => O(n) for texts, 2*O(n) for iterating thru call twice. O(n log n) for sorting the set, O(n) for printing the numbers,
                    O(n) + 2*O(n) + O(n log n) + O(n)
